RoboType is a simple Java application that simulates typing on your computer using the Robot class from java.awt. It takes input from the user, waits for 5 seconds to allow switching to another window or text field, and then automatically types the text with random delays for a more natural typing effect.

Features:
  Simulates human-like typing with varying speeds.
  Includes random deletions to mimic typing errors.
  Supports lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters

Usage: 
  Run the program.
  Enter the text you want to simulate typing.
  Switch to another window or text field within 5 seconds.
  Watch as RoboType types out your input.
  Enter 0 to type again, or any other input to stop the program.
